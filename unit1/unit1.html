    <ol> <p> <i> More About This Recipe </i> </p> </ol>

  

 <body>
   <ol> <p> Every culture seems to find a new and intriguing way to make dough, fill it with something delicious and create a lasting culinary tradition. Italians have been enjoying ravioli since at least the 14th century, when a Venetian cookbook manuscript suggested filling ravioli with green herbs, beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmering them in broth and seasoning them with "sweet and strong spices.” Regional variations on the classic style are found throughout Italy. In Rome, for example, the filling is often made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated lemon rind. While ravioli were traditionally rolled and shaped at home, prefilled frozen ravioli can make a home cook’s life much easier. This simple ravioli casserole is a no-fuss way to enjoy a warm and hearty pasta dish in a hurry. A jar of pasta sauce and some shredded cheese are added directly to the frozen noodles—no defrosting or boiling needed. The result is a ravioli bake that will become your go-to favorite for weeknight dinners and potluck offerings.</ol> </p>
